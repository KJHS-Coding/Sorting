Once each student has completed the exercises, it is time to give eachother
feedback.  Open an issue titled **Feedback for \<partnername\>** and write them
some comments on the work

- *Can you run their program?*
- Did they solve the exercises correctly?
- Is the code easy to understand?
- Did they leave good comments?
- Did they modify the README file with instructions for running their work?
- Where could they improve?
- Where did they do something really well?
- Can you give them some tips?
- Can you take some tips from them?

Conduct your discussion in the issue thread, and *link to at least two lines of code*.
Here are [emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) and [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) links.

Once you have both completed the feedback phase, close this issue.
