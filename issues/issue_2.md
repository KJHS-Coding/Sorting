# Linking to specific commits

It's worth learning how to link to specific lines of code in your repos.  This is very useful when having a discussion in an issue thread.

- Click "History" while looking at the file in GH (make sure you are on the right branch).
- Click the top (latest) commit and see the red/green diff.
- Click "View"
- Select line numbers on the left (hold shift) relevant to what you are talking about so that they become yellow
- Copy/paste the big url to link to that code.


The advantage of this is that you are linking directly back to the specific commit containing the code you are speaking about and that data will always be part of the git repo.

Here is an example of a [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink).  (Edit this file to view the raw markdown and syntax for creating a hyperlink.)
